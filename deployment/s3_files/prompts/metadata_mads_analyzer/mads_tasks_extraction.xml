        <sub_task>Extract components (country, state, city, etc.) if
        applicable.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Note any historical information about the location.</sub_task>

    <task>For topics and subjects: <sub_task>Identify the main concept and any qualifiers.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Note
        any hierarchical relationships to broader or narrower terms.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Extract any
        scope notes or definitions provided.</sub_task>
    </task>

    <task>Begin constructing the MADS record: <sub_task>Create the mads root element with
        appropriate version attribute.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Add the authority element with the
        authoritative form.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Add variant forms in variant elements.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Add
        related entities in related elements.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Include specific info elements
        (personInfo, organizationInfo, etc.).</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Add record metadata in the
        recordInfo element.</sub_task>
    </task>

    <task>Review the MADS record for completeness: <sub_task>Ensure all required elements are
        present.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>CRITICAL: Include ALL relevant MADS elements even if
        information is missing - use empty tags or placeholder values rather than omitting elements.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>For
        elements where no information was found, include the element with empty content (e.g.,
        &lt;namePart type="date"/&gt;) or a placeholder value.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Verify correct
        use of attributes and namespace declarations.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Check that relationships
        are properly expressed.</sub_task>
        <sub_task>Confirm that all extracted information is
        represented.</sub_task>
    </task>

    <task>Format the final MADS XML record according to the specifications in the mads_format.xml
        file.</task>
