    <title>MADS User Guidelines - Introduction and Implementation</title>

    <introduction>
        <overview>
            The Metadata Authority Description Schema (MADS) is an XML schema for an authority
            element set that may be used to provide metadata about authorized forms of agents (e.g.,
            people, organizations), events (e.g., conferences, meetings), and terms (e.g., topics,
            geographics, genres). MADS serves as a companion to the Metadata Object Description
            Schema (MODS) to provide metadata about the authoritative entities used in MODS
            descriptions. The standard is maintained by the MODS/MADS Editorial Committee with the
            Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress and input from
            users.

    <xml_structures>
        <description>
            MADS is expressed using the XML (Extensible Markup Language) schema language of the
            World Wide Web Consortium. XML provides markup for documents and allows more flexibility
            and detail than HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It serves well as a syntax for
            metadata.
        </description>

        <schema_definition>
            <principle>By using the XML schema language, MADS defines main elements, child elements
                (i.e., subelements), and attributes of elements and subelements.</principle>
            <data_content_rule>Data content is included in the lowest level elements so as to avoid
                "mixed content," which is when some elements contain character data interspersed
                with child elements.</data_content_rule>
            <container_elements>Some elements are only "containers"; a "container" element is one
                that it used to bind together subelements, but contains no data other than tags.</container_elements>
        </schema_definition>

        <attributes>
            <description>Attributes may be associated with elements at any level and are defined
                with the element with which they are associated. They serve to modify the element.</description>
            <rules>
                <rule>Attributes are not in a mandated sequence</rule>
                <rule>Attributes are not repeatable (per XML rules)</rule>
            </rules>
            <common_attributes>There are some common Attributes Used Throughout the MADS schema that
                have the same use and meaning with any element or subelement for which they are
                defined.</common_attributes>
        </attributes>

        <namespace>
            <declaration>A MADS document contains a schema declaration that indicates the MADS
                namespace: xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/mads/"</declaration>
        </namespace>

        <xslt_transformation>
            An "XSLT stylesheet" (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) may be written to
            transform the MADS data in some way for output. Examples include using a stylesheet to
            place the record into a template with easy-to-understand element names in XML; using a
            stylesheet to transform a MARC 21 authority record to MADS; or using a stylesheet to
            transform coded data into textual form.

        <root_elements>
            <individual_record>
                <element>mads</element>
                <description>Each individual MADS record is contained within the mads root element.</description>
            </individual_record>
            <collection>
                <element>madsCollection</element>
                <description>A MADS Collection is a group of MADS records that are contained within
                    the madsCollection root element.</description>
            </collection>
        </root_elements>

        <top_level_core_elements>
            <description>A MADS record (the elements within the mads tags) is made up of the
                following parts:</description>

            <authoritative_heading_label>
                <element>authority</element>
                <description>Consists of one or more authority elements. The authority element has
                    one or more descriptors (subelements): name, titleInfo, topic, temporal, genre,
                    geographic, hierarchicalGeographic, and/or occupation. There may be any
                    combination of these descriptors in any order. The authority element is repeated
                    only if needed to give multiple authoritative forms in different languages or
                    scripts.</description>
                <descriptors>
                    <descriptor>name</descriptor>
                    <descriptor>titleInfo</descriptor>
                    <descriptor>topic</descriptor>
                    <descriptor>temporal</descriptor>
                    <descriptor>genre</descriptor>
                    <descriptor>geographic</descriptor>
                    <descriptor>hierarchicalGeographic</descriptor>
                    <descriptor>occupation</descriptor>
                </descriptors>
            </authoritative_heading_label>

            <variant_heading_label>
                <element>variant</element>
                <description>Contains references to variant forms of the authoritative heading
                    label. The variant element includes one or more names or terms (i.e. descriptors
                    as above) that are alternate forms of the authoritative heading but are not
                    considered the authoritative form.</description>
                <example>If the person's authoritative name is John J. Jones, but he is sometimes
                    referred to as J.J. Jones, then J.J. Jones is referenced under variant.</example>
                <catalog_equivalent>In library catalogs the variant heading is equivalent to a "see"
                    reference and is not used in the bibliographic metadata; the variant form leads
                    users to the correct authoritative label form.</catalog_equivalent>
                <relationship>A special relationship between the variant and the authoritative
                    heading may be expressed in the type attribute of the variant element.</relationship>
            </variant_heading_label>

            <related_heading_label>
                <element>related</element>
                <description>Contains references to other related authority records. The related
                    element includes one or more names or terms (i.e., descriptors as above) that
                    have some relation to the authoritative heading and is a legitimate,
                    authoritative heading of its own.</description>
                <catalog_equivalent>The related element is equivalent to a "see also" reference in a
                    library catalog.</catalog_equivalent>
                <relationship>The relationship between the related and the authoritative heading may
                    be expressed in the type attribute of the related element.</relationship>
            </related_heading_label>

            <repeatability>There may be any number of variant and/or related elements in a MADS
                record. Both of these elements are composed of the same descriptors (subelements) as
                used under authority.</repeatability>
        </top_level_core_elements>

        <other_top_level_elements>
            <description>The following additional elements have been defined to provide additional
                information about the authoritative heading or the entity that it represents:</description>
            <elements>
                <element>affiliation</element>
                <element>classification</element>
                <element>fieldOfActivity</element>
                <element>identifier</element>
                <element>language</element>
                <element>note</element>
                <element>url</element>
                <element>extension</element>
            </elements>
        </other_top_level_elements>

        <administrative_element>
            <element>recordInfo</element>
            <description>Provides administrative information about the record and its metadata
                rather than about the authority itself.</description>
        </administrative_element>
    </record_structure>

    <implementation_notes>
        <cataloging_rules>
            <principle>Any set of cataloging rules may be used with MADS, as is the case with MODS
                and MARC 21.</principle>
        </cataloging_rules>

        <punctuation>
            <rule>If using International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) or other
                punctuation in creating MADS records, punctuation should be retained if it occurs
                within an element, but should be dropped between elements.</rule>
            <xslt_usage>If desired, an XSLT stylesheet may be used to generate an ISBD or other
                eye-readable display from the MADS elements and data, for instance the dash used in
                LCSH headings between facets.</xslt_usage>
            <example>
                <mads_metadata>
                    <authority>
                        <topic>Academic libraries</topic>

            </example>
        </punctuation>

        <record_identifier>
            <description>It is expected that a MADS record would have its own unique ID in addition
                to any other identifiers associated with the authority (which are indicated under
                identifier).</description>
            <location>The MADS record identifier is indicated in recordInfo/recordIdentifier.</location>
        </record_identifier>

        <root_elements_declaration>
            <principle>All MADS elements are declared as global. This allows them to be used as root
                elements for instance documents, or imported into other schemas.</principle>
        </root_elements_declaration>

                <status>mandatory</status>
                <version_attribute>The version of MADS used may be specified with the version
                    attribute. In version 2.0 the value "2.0" is enumerated in the schema, and thus
                    should be used as the value if the version attribute is included.</version_attribute>

                <status>recommended but not required</status>
            </recommended>
            <conditional>Some optional elements, if used, have mandatory subelements. See the
                individual element descriptions for further information. Profiles may be developed
                for specific applications, as needed, to specify other mandatory elements.</conditional>
        </mandatory_elements>

        <element_order>
            <principle>The order of elements in the MADS schema does not assume display order. A
                stylesheet is used to control the display order of MADS records.</principle>
        </element_order>

        <element_repeatability>
            <rule>All MADS top level elements are repeatable.</rule>
        </element_repeatability>

        <marc21_relationship>
            <overview>Most MADS elements have equivalent fields in the MARC 21 Authority Format.
                However, since MADS has fewer data elements than MARC authorities, records converted
                from MARC to MADS that are then converted back to MARC will lose some data or
                specificity of tagging.</overview>
            <no_equivalent>Where there is no equivalent MARC 21 element, the mapping section of the
                individual element description says: "There is no MARC 21 Authority field
                equivalent."</no_equivalent>
            <mapping_documentation>Each element and subelement description in this User Guide
                includes a MARC Mapping section that gives the general equivalencies between the
                MARC 21 Authority Format and MADS, but this is not intended to be a crosswalk that
                allows for bi-directional conversions without some loss of data. There is a separate
                mapping document.</mapping_documentation>

                Mapping to MADS Schema version 2.0.</reference>
