    <decision_tree_definition>
        <item>A decision tree is a structured representation of a decision-making process with logical pathways and conditional branching.</item>
        <item>Decision trees typically contain decision nodes (often diamond-shaped) that pose questions or evaluate conditions.</item>
        <item>Decision trees have pathways (arrows/lines) that connect nodes based on different conditions or responses.</item>
        <item>Decision trees include process nodes (often rectangular) that describe actions, procedures, or outcomes.</item>
        <item>Decision trees demonstrate logical flow from initial conditions through various pathways to final outcomes.</item>
        <item>Decision trees often include conditional branching (if/then logic, yes/no paths, probability-based outcomes).</item>
        <item>Decision trees may contain loop-back structures where certain conditions lead back to earlier decision points.</item>

    <decision_process>
        <item>Follow the two-step verification process defined in the decision_tree_verification_process.xml file.</item>
        <item>In the first pass, identify all potential decision-making structures and logical pathways.</item>
        <item>In the second pass, rigorously verify each potential decision tree against the defined criteria.</item>
        <item>Look for evidence of conditional branching - if X then Y, else Z type logic.</item>
        <item>Identify decision nodes, process nodes, pathways, and outcomes.</item>
        <item>Consider the context around each potential decision tree to avoid misclassification.</item>
        <item>For verified decision trees, ensure you capture the complete logical flow including all pathways and conditions.</item>
        <item>Pay attention to "choose your own adventure" elements where multiple valid paths exist.</item>
        <item>Capture loop-back structures and cross-references to other figures or sections.</item>

        <item>Map all possible routes from entry points to end points.</item>
        <item>Identify conditions that determine which pathway is taken.</item>
        <item>Recognize that multiple valid endpoints may exist for different scenarios.</item>

        <item>Capture user-dependent pathways where routes change based on user responses or characteristics.</item>
