            <tactical_summary>
                <situation>Map depicts the climactic Confederate infantry assault known as Pickett's
                    Charge, showing approximately 12,500 Confederate soldiers advancing across open
                    ground against fortified Union positions.</situation>
                <key_features>The map emphasizes the exposed nature of the Confederate advance, the
                    converging attack vectors, and the strong Union defensive position behind the
                    stone wall.</key_features>
                <apparent_objective>The map illustrates the tactical situation that led to the
                    Confederate defeat, showing why the assault failed due to the long approach over
                    open terrain against prepared defenses.</apparent_objective>
