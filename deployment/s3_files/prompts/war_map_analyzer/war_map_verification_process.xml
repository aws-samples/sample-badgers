<!-- This file defines the verification process for war map detection and analysis -->
<war_map_verification_process>
    <!-- Initial step to ensure focus on the target image -->
    <initial_step>
        <instruction>Confirm that you are working ONLY with the final target image provided for
            analysis. Disregard all previous example images.</instruction>
    </initial_step>

    <!-- First pass: Identification of war map content -->
    <pass_1_identification>
        <step>Scan ONLY the target image for military cartographic content.</step>
        <step>Look for key indicators: military symbols, movement arrows, unit positions,
            fortifications, tactical annotations.</step>
        <step>If no military map content is found, proceed to final_verification to report no war
            map detected.</step>
        <step>If potential war map content is found, note all areas of interest in your analysis.</step>
        <step>Confirm that you have not considered any example images in this process.</step>
    </pass_1_identification>

    <!-- Second pass: Detailed extraction -->
    <pass_2_extraction>
        <!-- Criteria for war map verification -->
        <war_map_criteria>
            <criterion>Contains military unit symbols, positions, or designations.</criterion>
            <criterion>Shows movement indicators (arrows, lines) representing military operations.</criterion>
            <criterion>Includes tactical or strategic annotations.</criterion>
            <criterion>Depicts fortifications, defensive positions, or military installations.</criterion>
            <criterion>Contains terrain analysis relevant to military operations.</criterion>
            <criterion>Shows temporal progression of military events.</criterion>
            <criterion>Includes a legend explaining military symbology.</criterion>
        </war_map_criteria>

        <!-- At least TWO criteria should be met for classification as a war map -->
        <minimum_criteria>At least TWO of the above criteria must be present to classify as a war
            map.</minimum_criteria>

    <!-- Exhaustive capture -->
    <exhaustive_capture>
        <step>For verified war maps, extract ALL visible information following the extraction
            priorities.</step>
        <step>Do not skip elements because they seem minor - capture everything.</step>
        <step>When text is partially visible or unclear, note what can be read and indicate
            uncertainty.</step>
        <step>For ambiguous symbols, describe visually and provide possible interpretations.</step>
        <step>Note any damage, fading, or obscured areas that limit extraction.</step>
    </exhaustive_capture>

    <!-- Historical context analysis -->
    <historical_context_analysis>
        <step>Based on visual evidence, attempt to identify the specific conflict depicted.</step>
        <step>Look for clues: unit designations, place names, uniform styles, equipment,
            cartographic conventions.</step>
        <step>Note the apparent perspective (which side created the map).</step>
        <step>Identify the map's apparent purpose (tactical planning, historical record,
            educational).</step>
        <step>Distinguish between contemporary maps and later historical reconstructions.</step>
    </historical_context_analysis>

    <!-- Final verification -->
    <final_verification>
        <step>Review your extraction for completeness - have you captured all visible elements?</step>
        <step>Verify that all information comes from the target image only.</step>
        <step>Ensure your tactical summary accurately reflects what the map shows.</step>
        <step>Confirm you have distinguished between explicit information and your interpretations.</step>
        <step>If no war map content was found, prepare the appropriate not_found response.</step>
