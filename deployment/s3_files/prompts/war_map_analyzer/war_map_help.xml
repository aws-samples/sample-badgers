        <item>Analyze ONLY the final image provided for analysis. NEVER analyze any example images
            provided earlier.</item>
        <item>Absence of war map content is a valid outcome. Do not force identification if no
            military cartographic content is present.</item>
        <item>Be exhaustive - extract EVERYTHING visible on the map.</item>
        <item>When uncertain about symbology, describe what you see and provide possible
            interpretations.</item>
        <item>Distinguish between what is explicitly shown and what you are inferring.</item>

    <war_map_definition>
        <item>A war or battle map is a cartographic representation of military operations,
            positions, or terrain for military purposes.</item>
        <item>War maps typically show troop positions, movements, fortifications, and tactically
            significant terrain.</item>
        <item>They may depict a single engagement, a campaign, or strategic overview of a theater of
            operations.</item>
        <item>War maps use specialized symbology to represent military units, movements, and
            installations.</item>
        <item>They often include temporal elements showing the progression of military operations.</item>
