        <instruction>Before extracting map elements, perceive the tactical picture:</instruction>
        <step>View the entire map to understand the geographic scope and scale.</step>
        <step>Identify the legend/key - this defines symbol meanings.</step>
        <step>Note the primary opposing forces and their general positions.</step>
        <step>Identify terrain features that influence tactical interpretation.</step>
        <step>Observe movement arrows and their directions to understand the action flow.</step>

        <primary principle="holistic_tactical_view">
            <guidance> Understand the overall tactical situation before details: - What is the geographic area depicted? - What time period/phase of operations? - Who are the opposing forces? - What is the general disposition of forces? This context informs interpretation of individual symbols. </guidance>
        </primary>

        <primary principle="similarity">
            <guidance> Symbol consistency indicates force identification: - Same symbol shape = same unit type - Same color = same side/force - Same size = same echelon level Use the legend to establish symbol-meaning mappings, then apply consistently. </guidance>
        </primary>

        <primary principle="common_fate">
            <guidance> Movement arrows indicate operational flow: - Arrows pointing same direction = coordinated movement - Converging arrows = concentration of forces - Diverging arrows = dispersal or envelopment - Opposing arrows = engagement or confrontation </guidance>
        </primary>

        <secondary principle="figure_ground">
            <guidance> Separate tactical information from base map: - FIGURE: Unit symbols, movement arrows, defensive positions, objectives - GROUND: Terrain, roads, rivers, place names (context, not primary data) Extract tactical overlay; use geographic base for context. </guidance>

    <validation>
        <instruction>After extraction, verify map perception accuracy:</instruction>
        <check>Did you establish the overall tactical context before detail extraction?</check>
        <check>Are symbols consistently interpreted using similarity and legend reference?</check>
        <check>Are movement flows correctly captured using common fate?</check>
        <check>Is tactical information (figure) correctly separated from base map (ground)?</check>
        <check>Does the extracted data tell a coherent tactical story?</check>
