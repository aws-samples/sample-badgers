        <item>Analyze ONLY the final image provided for analysis. NEVER analyze any of the example images provided earlier.</item>
        <item>Absence of educational transcripts is a valid and expected outcome. Do not force identification.</item>
        <item>When in doubt, do NOT classify a document as a transcript. Accuracy is more important than comprehensiveness.</item>
        <item>NEVER classify report cards, grade sheets, or course schedules as transcripts.</item>
        <item>Transcripts must contain cumulative academic records spanning multiple courses or terms.</item>
    </critical_instructions>

    <transcript_definition>
        <item>A transcript is an official or unofficial document from an educational institution documenting cumulative academic history.</item>
        <item>Must include: courses taken, grades earned, credits awarded, and typically cumulative metrics (GPA).</item>
        <item>Spans multiple terms, semesters, or academic years - not just a single grading period.</item>
        <item>Issued by the institution's registrar or records office.</item>
        <item>May include degree conferral information, honors, and authentication features.</item>
    </transcript_definition>

    <not_transcripts>
        <item>Single-term report cards (only show one grading period).</item>
        <item>Individual course grade sheets (only show one course).</item>
        <item>Diplomas or certificates alone (credential without course history).</item>
        <item>Course catalogs (describe available courses, not student records).</item>
        <item>Class schedules (show enrolled courses, not completed grades).</item>
        <item>Enrollment verification letters (confirm attendance, not grades).</item>
        <item>Degree audit worksheets (planning documents, not official records).</item>
        <item>Academic planning documents (future courses, not completed work).</item>
