<!-- This file defines the two-step verification process for LaTeX formula detection -->
<latex_verification_process>
    <!-- Initial step to ensure focus on the target image -->
    <initial_step>
        <instruction>Confirm that you are working ONLY with the final target image provided for
            analysis. Disregard all previous example images.</instruction>
    </initial_step>

    <!-- First pass: Identification of potential LaTeX formulas -->
    <pass_1_identification>
        <!-- Scan only the target image -->
        <step>Scan ONLY within the target image for potential LaTeX formula structures.</step>
        <!-- Early exit if no formulas found -->
        <step>If no potential formulas are found, immediately skip to the final_verification step.</step>
        <!-- Mark potential formulas -->
        <step>Mark all potential LaTeX formula areas in the target image and save it in your mind.</step>
        <!-- Confirmation to avoid example image analysis -->
        <step>Confirm that you have not considered any example images in this process.</step>
    </pass_1_identification>

    <!-- Second pass: Verification of identified potential formulas -->
    <pass_2_verification>
        <!-- Criteria for LaTeX formula verification -->
        <latex_criteria>
            <criterion>Contains LaTeX-specific commands (e.g., \frac, \sum, \int)</criterion>
            <criterion>Uses mathematical symbols or Greek letters</criterion>
            <criterion>Structured with proper LaTeX syntax (e.g., proper use of {}, ^, _)</criterion>
            <criterion>Represents a complete mathematical expression or equation</criterion>
        </latex_criteria>
        <!-- Context checking for each potential formula -->
        <context_check>
            <step>Analyze text immediately before and after the potential LaTeX formula in the
                target image, to help you. Don't return that text, just keep it in your mind.</step>
            <step>Check for equation numbers or labels associated with the formula in the target
                image.</step>
            <step>Reject if part of a larger text section without clear mathematical content.</step>
        </context_check>
        <!-- Additional checks to prevent example image analysis -->
        <additional_checks>
            <step>For each potential formula, explicitly confirm it exists in the target image, not
                in any example.</step>
            <step>If you realize a formula is from an example, immediately discard it.</step>
        </additional_checks>
    </pass_2_verification>

    <!-- Capture verified LaTeX formulas -->
    <full_latex_capture>
        <step>If a LaTeX formula is verified in the target image, capture all related LaTeX code
            within the formula element according to the format provided.</step>
        <step>If no formulas were found or verified, prepare to report that no formulas were
            detected.</step>
    </full_latex_capture>

    <!-- Final verification to ensure accuracy -->
    <final_verification>
        <step>Review each captured formula and confirm its presence in the target image.</step>
        <step>If any doubt exists about a formula's source, discard it.</step>
        <step>Confirm one last time that you have only analyzed the target image and have not
            included any information from the example images.</step>
    </final_verification>
