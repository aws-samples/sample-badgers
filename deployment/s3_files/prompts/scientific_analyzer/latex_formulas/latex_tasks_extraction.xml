<!-- Outlines the steps for identifying and extracting LaTeX formulas -->
<tasks>
    <task>Perform the first pass identification of potential LaTeX formula structures as defined in the latex_verification_process.xml file.</task>
    <task>For each identified potential formula, perform the second pass verification against the strict criteria.</task>
    <task>Analyze the context surrounding each potential formula to ensure accurate classification.</task>
    <task>For verified formulas, ensure you capture the full LaTeX code, including all commands and syntax.</task>
    <task>If no structures meet the criteria for a LaTeX formula after the two-pass verification, respond ONLY with the not_found_response as specified.</task>
